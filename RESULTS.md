Chronological record. Append new entries; never overwrite old results. Distinguish measured observations from interpretations and note replication status.

## 2026-10-03 — Repository foundation

- **Experiment ID:** None (scaffolding only).
- **Configuration:** Python 3.11.9; PyTorch and pytest were available locally. Tests and smoke check were run with CUDA hidden and CPU tensors. No training or benchmark run was performed.
- **Baseline:** Not applicable.
- **Result:** Seven foundation tests passed, and the no-training CPU smoke check passed. Tests cover deterministic initialization, model shapes and CPU execution, input validation, and append-only JSONL logging.
- **Uncertainty:** A clean-environment dependency installation has not been checked; EXP-001 has not run.
- **Replicated:** Not applicable.
- **What changed:** Phase 0 foundation is ready; EXP-001 remains the next experiment.
